                About Me 
            </h2>
            <br />
            <p> 
                I live in Los Ba単os, Laguna but moved here in Dasmari単as, Cavite because of college. I rarely leave my dorm so I'm still not used to my surrounding. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p> 
                I took Computer Science because I am passionate about computers and technology, and I want to have a career in a field that I love. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p> 
                I decided to join Lasallian Codespace Bootcamp because I want to get more experience in college so I can be more knowledgeable and ready once I graduate. I also want to meet like-minded individuals and make friends with others.
            </p>

            <p> 
                I am single....
